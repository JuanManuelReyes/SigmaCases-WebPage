# Sigma Cases - Web Page

## Project Description

>This repository is dedicated to a personal project to develop the Front-End of a website. The objective of this project is to practice the bases of HTML5 and CSS3 using different Frameworks and some JS for the development of certain dynamic functionalities.
>The design of this page was inspired by a friend's enterprise which is dedicated to the sale of handmade phone cases.
This website does not have a backend because in the first instance I want to practice FrontEnd without the use of Backend.
